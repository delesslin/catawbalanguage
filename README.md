CATAWBA GAME
########################################
Start simple: a catawba word is shown and options are given
Then make it beautiful: RESPONSIVE, MOBILE-FRIENDLY IS A MUST
--Add some fun animations using a javascript library
Then implement that sometimes it shows english and sometimes catawba
Then implement lessons
Then implement pictures as the question
Then implement login to track how you're doing









##########################################
KEYBOARD
##########################################
Constructor function that takes a parent div as an argument (should default to "#keyboard")
On .show() function will fill the parent div with keys. This should be responsive. if "self.on = true" then it also sets up listeners.
There should also be a way to define where the output goes
Eventually it should take a keyboadLayout object which defines characters, fonts, etc for the keyboard
Should also listen for clicks on the visual keyboard



Is there a library for keyboards?
--No, but there is a library for capturing keycodes: Keypress https://dmauro.github.io/Keypress/
