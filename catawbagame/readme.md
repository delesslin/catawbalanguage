=======CATAWBA GAME=============
******************************//

Goal: A game for practicing Catawba language
Method: A random word is selected from all vocabulary. That is the question. Then other options are selected from the data;
--How can I refactor this to choose a specific word
----Program should eventually work with an account's lesson plan
--How can I make this work with accounts?
----Libraries for dealing with accounts?
--How can I refactor to include images?
++How should this data be structured++d
----There will definitely be a Catawba word
----All words will have a translation
------Some entries will have multiple translations
----Some words will have alternative spellings?
------Is this something we want to encourage or should we move toward standardized spellings?
----Some words will have related/alternative words
------How will I distinguish from alt-spellings?
-----Some words will have pictures to accompany
------Some words will have multiple pictures
------How do I clarify ambiguous pictures
--------If it appears in the game, the translation(s) should appear below the picture or upon clicking
-----Words should probably have pronunciation(S)
-----Words should have multiple examples.
-----How do I deal with the -fixes?
------The -fixes should probably be a functional thing.
--------EG: sometimes the vocab word chichi should chichina with the options "my mother" included
--------When people dictionary search they should see the multiple uses of the word
----------Double check how we would say "your mother her brother"
----------Is it it chichiye mbarawa?
